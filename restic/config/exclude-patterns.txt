# Restic Exclude Patterns Configuration
#
# Add patterns for files/directories to exclude from backups
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
# Empty lines are also ignored
# 
# Pattern syntax:
# - Use * for wildcards (e.g., *.tmp)
# - Use ** for recursive matching (e.g., **/cache/**)
# - Exact paths work too (e.g., /data/temp)
#
# Common exclusions:

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.temp
*.swp
*.swo
*~

# Cache directories
**/cache/**
**/.cache/**
**/tmp/**

# System files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
desktop.ini

# Log files (optional - uncomment if you don't want to backup logs)
# *.log
# **/logs/**

# Node modules (if backing up code)
# **/node_modules/**

# Python virtual environments (if backing up code)
# **/.venv/**
# **/venv/**
# **/__pycache__/**
